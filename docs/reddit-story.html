    Reddit feels chaotic on the surface. Millions of users. Tens of thousands of communities. 
    Endless threads branching, colliding, and disappearing every day. It looks like random noise.
    Yet, <strong>beneath that noise there lies some structure <br></strong> 

    We know that reddit communities form around shared interests. Links between them show how ideas move from one place to another. 
    Some communities attract attention, others redirect it. 
    Conflict spreads through these connections, and language shifts depending on who is speaking and who is being discussed. 
    Taken together, these interactions reveal that Reddit is not just a collection of posts, 
    but a living network shaped by how communities connect and respond to one another. It is almost like a living network. Which leads us to question: <br>

    <strong>  What does this collective brain look like when examined through different lenses? <br></strong> <br>

    This will not be a story about individual posts or viral moments. 
    But one that uncovers the hidden patterns that emerge when millions of small actions accumulate. <br>

    <strong><em> Let's dive into Reddit's collective consciousness and uncover the patterns within.</em></strong>

      <h2 class="section-title text-center">Reddit's Hidden Architecture</h2>
    </div>

    <!-- CHAPTER 1 -->
    <h3 id="continents-roads" class="section-header text-center">The Map: Continents and Roads</h3>
    <p>
      Reddit has <strong>50,000+</strong> subreddits. If we treat every subreddit as totally unique,
      we get lost in the small details and miss the bigger picture. So, we start with a simple idea:
      group similar communities into a smaller number of “continents”.
    </p>
    <div class="media-row" style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;gap:1rem;align-items:center;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;margin-top:1.2rem;">
      <div class="media-text" style="flex:1 1 320px;min-width:260px;padding:0 1rem;text-align:left;">
      <p>
        To do that, we use <strong>subreddit embeddings</strong>: a 300-dimensional fingerprint for every subreddit.
        Two subreddits have similar fingerprints when <strong>similar users post in them</strong>.
        That means the embeddings capture something powerful: not what a subreddit claims to be,
        but what it shares with others through real user behavior.
      </p>
      </div>

      <figure class="media-frame" style="flex:1 1 320px;min-width:260px;margin:0;">

        <strong>The problem:</strong> a giant list of subreddits feels like noise.
      </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
      This is the moment the story becomes measurable: Reddit stops being a list of names and becomes a landscape.
      Allowing us to ask: <strong>What does this landscape look like when we compress it into a human-scale map?</strong>
    </p>

    <!-- CHAPTER 2 -->
    <h3 id="continents-40" class="section-header text-center">The 40 continents of Reddit</h3>

        <p>
          Each subreddit has a <strong>300-dimensional</strong> embedding. That's very powerful, however it's hard to visualize.
          So before clustering, we used <strong>PCA</strong> to reduce the number of dimensions while maintaining most of the information.
        </p>

    <div class="media-row" style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;gap:1rem;align-items:center;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;margin-top:1.2rem;">
      
      <!-- PCA IMAGE -->
      <figure class="media-frame" style="flex:1 1 380px;min-width:280px;margin:0;">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/pca_variance.png' | relative_url }}" alt="PCA explained variance scree plot" loading="lazy" style="width:100%;height:auto;display:block;" />
        <figcaption class="caption-center">
          <strong>PCA check:</strong> the space has structure — then diminishing returns.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <!-- PCA TEXT -->
      <div class="media-text" style="flex:1 1 380px;min-width:280px;padding:0 1rem;text-align:left;">
        <p style="margin-top:0.5rem;">
              We used PCA (Principal Component Analysis) to verify that the data has structure, 90% of its variance is captured in only 50 dimensions, then applied K-Means clustering.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>

      <p style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
      We had a clear goal: compress 50k+ communities into a manageable list. This simplifies Reddit's vast landscape into a map we can actually grasp.
      And to do so, we use <strong>K-Means</strong>, which groups the subreddits into <strong>40 topic blocs</strong>
      (Politics, Music, Sports, Tech, and so on).
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we quickly encounter a big issue: algorithms don't understand human culture.
      They don't understand parody, irony or sarcasm.
      So we have to interfere to maintain some of the details that get lost in the algorithm: <strong>we manually correct a small set of edge cases</strong>.
      Not to “cheat” the system but to keep the map meaningful for a human reader.
    </p>

    <div style="height: 600px; overflow: hidden; background: white;">

      <strong>Explore the map:</strong> Hover over any node to see the representative subreddits that define that cluster.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
      Now we have the continents. But a still map with no movement cannot describe the ever moving nature of reddit's threads.
      The real story starts when we ask: <strong>if Reddit has continents what paths connect them?</strong>
    </p>


    <!-- CHAPTER 3 -->
    <h3 id="paths" class="section-header text-center">If subreddits communicate, what paths connect them?</h3>
    <p>
      Our “paths” are <strong>hyperlinks</strong>: when subreddit A links to subreddit B it's a form of communication that can be either friendly, 
      hostile or just neutral. Each link is not just a connection but it carries a specific <strong>tone</strong>. 
      By tracking link tone at scale, we can track how both attention and conflicts travel across Reddit.
    </p>
    <div class="media-stack" style="display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:1.5rem;margin-top:1.2rem;width:100%;">

      <!-- Row 1: image left, text on the right -->
      <div class="media-row" style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;gap:1rem;align-items:center;flex-wrap:wrap;">
        <figure class="media-frame" style="flex:1 1 320px;min-width:260px;margin:0;">
          <img src="{{ '/assets/img/reddit_positivity.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Example of a supportive link" loading="lazy" style="width:100%;height:auto;display:block;" />
          <figcaption class="caption-center"><strong>Support:</strong> “Go see this.”</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <div class="media-text" style="flex:1 1 320px;min-width:260px;padding:0 1rem;text-align:left;">
          <h4> Uplifting links</h4>
          <p> Sometimes a subreddit links to another community simply to share something positive or noteworthy. 
            The conversation that follows isn't about winning or competing, it simply adds gratitude, empathy, or humor. 
            These links quietly weave Reddit's web, using attention to amplify and celebrate rather than to attack. </p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <!-- Row 2: image right, text on the left -->
      <div class="media-row" style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;gap:1rem;align-items:center;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;">
        <div class="media-text" style="flex:1 1 320px;min-width:260px;padding:0 1rem;text-align:left;">
          <h4> Provocative links </h4>
          <p> Other links point to content as a form of critique or callout. 
            The original post can serve as a proxy for a wider cultural debate, and the discussion often escalates into mockery or even outrage. 
            These links show how conflict and scrutiny spread across the platform. </p>
        </div>

        <figure class="media-frame" style="flex:1 1 320px;min-width:260px;margin:0;">
          <img src="{{ '/assets/img/reddit_negativity.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Example of a hostile link" loading="lazy" style="width:100%;height:auto;display:block;" />
          <figcaption class="caption-center"><strong>Attack:</strong> “Look at this mess.”</figcaption>
        </figure>
      </div>

    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
      This raises the core tone question: when one subreddit links to another, is it usually an attack or is it more often a peaceful share / a positive recommendation?
    </p>

    <!-- CHAPTER 4 -->
    <h3 id="links-tone" class="section-header text-center">How are most of the links?</h3>
    <div class="media-row" style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;gap:1rem;align-items:center;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;margin-top:1.2rem;">
      <div class="media-text" style="flex:1 1 320px;min-width:260px;padding:0 1rem;text-align:left;">
      <p>
        The answer may surprise you: negative links are rare. Even across different topic communities, most links are positive or neutral.
        Within-cluster links are 93.6% positive or neutral, and cross-cluster links are 88.9% positive or neutral.
        Negative links are the exception, showing that Reddit's discussion threads are generally collaborative rather than combative.
      </p>
      </div>

      <figure class="media-frame" style="flex:1.3667 1 320px;min-width:260px;margin:0;">
      <img src="{{ '/assets/img/sentiment_distribution.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Positive vs negative link distribution" loading="lazy" style="width:100%;height:auto;display:block;" />
      <figcaption class="caption-center">
        <strong>Baseline:</strong> positivity dominates; negativity is the minority.
      </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
      Now that we have a better understanding of the links between subreddits, we can turn to a new question: how is the activity distributed across the platform? 
      Are most of the interactions concentrated in a handful of communities, or is engagement spread out more evenly
    </p>

    <!-- CHAPTER 5 -->
    <h3 id="concentrate" class="section-header text-center">Where do most interactions concentrate?</h3>


    <p>
      The two plots below answer that directly. The left chart shows the subreddits that
      <strong>send</strong> the most links (the loudest broadcasters). The right chart shows the subreddits that
      <strong>receive</strong> the most links (the biggest magnets of attention).
    </p>

    <div class="media-row" style="display:flex;flex-direction:row;gap:1rem;align-items:center;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;margin-top:1.2rem;">
      <figure class="media-frame" style="flex:1 1 320px;min-width:260px;margin:0;">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/top_sources.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Top link sources" loading="lazy" style="width:100%;height:auto;display:block;" />
        <figcaption class="caption-center">
          <strong>Who speaks:</strong> a small set of communities produce a big share of outgoing links.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>

      <figure class="media-frame" style="flex:1 1 320px;min-width:260px;margin:0;">
        <img src="{{ '/assets/img/top_targets.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Top link targets" loading="lazy" style="width:100%;height:auto;display:block;" />
        <figcaption class="caption-center">
          <strong>Who gets noticed:</strong> large “front-page” hubs attract links from everywhere.
        </figcaption>
      </figure>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
      The pattern is clear: interactions on Reddit are <strong>not evenly distributed</strong>.
      A few communities act like <strong>megaphones</strong> (they link out constantly),
      while a few massive hubs (like broad Q&amp;A and general interest subreddits) act like <strong>public squares</strong>
      where everyone points, reacts, and piles in.
    </p>

    <p>
      But volume alone doesn't tell us the whole story. High activity doesn't inherently mean a community is dominating or being attacked. 
      The same patterns of linking can reflect very different roles depending on context.

      And this is where the story becomes interesting: these high-volume linkers are not always “bad”,
      and these high-volume targets are not always “victims”.
      Sometimes a community is a curator that boosts content.
      Sometimes it is a watchdog that calls out others.
      Sometimes it is a lightning rod that absorbs reactions simply because it is big.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
      This raises a clear follow up  question 
      <strong>what role does each of the main actors play in the network?</strong>
      Who are the amplifiers, the critics, the bridges, and the punching bags of Reddit?
    </p>


  </div>
  <h3 id="roles-4" class="section-header text-center">The 4 main roles</h3>
  <p>
    After mapping the continents, we zoom in on the <strong>voice</strong> each cluster tends to produce.
    We can use four roles to classify most of the Subreddits:<br>
    <div style="text-align:center;">
      <p style="margin:0;"></p>
        <strong>Influential</strong>: Large number of incoming positive links,<br>
        <strong>Supportive</strong>: Large number of outgoing positive links,<br>
        <strong>Controversial</strong>: High number of incoming negative links,<br>
        <strong>Critical</strong>: High number of outgoing negative links.
      </p>
    </div>
  </p>

  <h3 id="social-compass" class="section-header text-center" style="margin-top:2.5rem;">Reddit's Social Compass</h3>

  <div class="media-row" style="display:flex;gap:1.8rem;align-items:center;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;margin-top:1.2rem;">
    <div class="viz-col" style="flex:1 1 520px;min-width:300px;">
      <div style="height: 600px; overflow: hidden;">
        <iframe
          src="{{ '/assets/visualizations/roles_quadrant_scatter.html' | relative_url }}"
          width="100%"

          style="border: none;"
          title="Interactive Social Compass"
          scrolling="no"
        ></iframe>
      </div>
      <p class="caption-center" style="margin-top: 10px; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #666;">
        <strong>Interactive:</strong> Scroll to zoom, drag to pan. Hover for details.<br>
        <strong>X-Axis:</strong> positivity (Outgoing) | <strong>Y-Axis:</strong> Controversy (Incoming)
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="media-text" style="flex:0 1 380px;min-width:260px;padding:0 0.5rem;text-align:left;">
      <p style="margin:0 0 0.8rem 0;">
        <strong>To see how these roles manifest in practice, we mapped the top 200 active subreddits</strong>
      </p>
      <p style="margin:0;">
        The results are striking: Communities generating or attracting negative links (Critical and Controversial) are present, but they make up only a small fraction compared to the much larger Supportive clusters. 
        This helps explain why Reddit can feel both peaceful and chaotic: most interactions are constructive, while a small number of communities produce a disproportionate share of friction.
      </p>

  </div>

    <h3 id="nervous-compass" class="section-header text-center" style="margin-top:2.5rem;">The Nervous System</h3>

    <p>
      We've mapped individual subreddits, but to understand the ecosystem, we need to zoom out 
      to the <strong>40 topic clusters</strong> we identified earlier. 
      Does <em>r/Politics</em> behave like <em>r/Gaming</em>? Is <em>r/Tech</em> more hostile than <em>r/Sports</em>?
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 1.2rem;">
      These aren't isolated dots on a chart ,they're living communities wired together by thousands of hyperlinks. 
      Below, we visualize Reddit's complete neural network: clusters grouped by social role, 
      connected by the conversations that flow between them.

    <h3 id="topics-roles" style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">Which Topics Dominate Each Role?</h3>
    <p>
      The network shows connections, but not composition. 
      Politics and Gaming both appear,but do they play the same role? 
      Let's break down the <strong>topic clusters</strong> that fill each of the four archetypes.
    </p>
  </div>

    <!-- ROLE 1: INFLUENTIAL (VIZ LEFT, IMAGE RIGHT) -->
    <h3 id="role-influential" class="section-header text-center" style="margin-top:3rem;">Influential</h3>

      <div class="media-row" style="display:flex;gap:1.8rem;align-items:center;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;margin-top:1.2rem;">

          />
        </div>

        loading="lazy"
        style="width:340px;max-width:80%;height:auto;display:block;margin:0 auto 1rem auto;"
      />
      <p style="margin:0;text-align:left;padding:0 0.5rem;">
        <strong>The hubs.</strong> These clusters sit at the center of attention and shape what “average Reddit” sees.
        Their power is reach: they don't need to be extreme to dominate the flow of links.
        The "Help/Advice/Q&A" cluster is the most influential on Reddit (83.5%), followed closely by "Lifestyle" and "Tech."
      </p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
    If Influential clusters are where attention concentrates, Supportive clusters are where attention turns into care.
  </p>


  <!-- ROLE 2: SUPPORTIVE -->
  <h3 id="role-supportive" class="section-header text-center" style="margin-top:3rem;">Supportive</h3>

  <div class="media-row" style="display:flex;gap:1.8rem;align-items:center;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:space-between;margin-top:1.2rem;">

        loading="lazy"
        style="width:340px;max-width:80%;height:auto;display:block;margin:0 auto 1rem auto;"
      />
      <p style="margin:0;text-align:left;padding:0 0.5rem;">
        <strong>The helpers.</strong> These clusters turn participation into support: advice, empathy, coping, recovery,
        and practical help. Their outbound links tend to uplift or guide, not to punish.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- RIGHT: VIZ -->
    <div class="viz-col" style="flex:1 1 520px;min-width:300px;">

      />
    </div>
  </div>

  <p style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
    But not every community exists to help or inform. Some exist to fight.
  </p>


  <!-- ROLE 3: CONTROVERSIAL (VIZ LEFT, IMAGE RIGHT) -->
  <h3 id="role-controversial" class="section-header text-center" style="margin-top:3rem;">Controversial</h3>

        <strong>The lightning rods.</strong> They don't always start fights, but fights find them.
        Threads here turn into battlegrounds, and links often carry “look at this” energy, supportive or hostile.
        Unsurprisingly, <strong>Politics/Extremism</strong> takes the top spot. 
        Interestingly, <strong>Meta-Commentary</strong> (subreddits that talk <em>about</em> Reddit) is the second most controversial. 
        When you police the internet, the internet fights back.

    <h3 class="text-center">To truly understand the map, we need to ask: which communities hold the most influence? 
      Who sets the stage, who bridges isolated corners, and who ultimately shapes what users encounter?</h3>

    <p>
      Up to now, we treated Reddit like a flat map: continents (<strong>topics</strong>) and paths (<strong>hyperlinks</strong>). But power is not distributed evenly.
      Power is not about being “right” or “loud”,
      it's about position: who sits at the center, who acts as a bridge, and who everyone points at
    </p>

    <p>
      To understand the "Power Game" of Reddit, we calculated <strong>PageRank</strong> (prestige) and <strong>Betweenness</strong> (influence) for every cluster. 
      This tells us who actually holds the keys to the kingdom.

      The takeaway is simple: Reddit is not flat. A small set of hubs shape discovery, 
      and a unique set of bridges connect the silos.

      <strong>when conflict happens, does it follow these power lines?</strong>

    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Key Insight: The "One-Sided" Wars</h4>
      <strong>Politics/Extremism</strong> sit at the center of the network's crossfire. They are linked to and attacked from multiple directions, 
      from geographic communities to tech forums and shitposting hubs, making them the network's primary punching bag. <br>
      Another striking pattern is the thick band between <strong>Help/Advice</strong> and <strong>Memes</strong>, 
      likely the largest cultural clash on the site: earnest problem-solvers colliding with irony, humor, and casual trolling.
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">
        Together, these patterns clarify what power looks like on Reddit.
        High <strong>PageRank</strong> (Prestige) doesn't protect you, it makes you a target. 
        <em>Help/Advice</em> and <em>Politics</em> are the biggest hubs, so they draw the most fire. 
        On Reddit, you don't get to be powerful without getting into a fight.
      </p>
      <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        But conflict is only half the story. 
        If we flip the filter from "Hostile" to "Supportive," a completely different map emerges.
        <br>
        So the next question becomes: <strong>Who are the allies?</strong>

    </p>

    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">Key Insight: Unexpected Alliances</h4>
    <p>
      While ideological rivals clash loudly, many alliances form around shared interests.
      Strong support networks emerge between communities centered on <em>Music</em>, <em>Games</em>, and <em>Sports</em>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even <em>Politics</em> and <em>Activism</em> show a softer side: sending substantial supportive traffic toward <em>Lifestyle</em> and <em>Home</em> communities. 
      Perhaps even the most engaged activists need spaces to step back and recharge.
    </p>
    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:3rem;">
      <p>
        So far, we have focused on <strong>Mutual</strong> relationships. Rivals exchange attacks, allies support one another. But Reddit is rarely symmetrical.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many cases, hostility flows in only one direction. 
        Some communities attack repeatedly, while others rarely respond. 
        What happens when a community becomes a target for many, yet never strikes back?

    <p>
      Not every target is a victim, and not every attacker is "evil." But the network gives us a concrete way to tell the difference:
      <strong>net negativity flow</strong>, the amount of negative links a continent receives minus what it sends.
    </p>

    <p>
      This immediately separates two groups. Some communities act as <strong>punching bags</strong>, absorbing negativity from many directions. Others are <strong>bullies</strong>, consistently sending negativity outward. 
      The distinction is crucial: being controversial because you are highly visible is very different from being aggressive by design.

    <!-- Insight section -->
    <div style="max-width: 800px; margin: 4rem auto 0 auto;">
      
      <p>
        The punching bags tend to be mainstream hubs: highly visible, generic and easy to mock. On Reddit scale is a liability. 
        The attackers, by contrast, are often smaller niche communities that define themselves through opposition. For them hostility isn't incidental, it becomes their identity.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 1.5rem;">
        This imbalance shows up clearly in the numbers. 
        Meta-Commentary's net aggression (+24,821) is 2.6x larger than the biggest victim's deficit (Memes: -9,601). 
        Negativity doesn't spread evenly, it concentrates at its source and then fans out across many targets. 
        A small number of aggressive communities generate a disproportionate share of hostile links.
      </p>

      <h4 style="margin-top: 2.5rem; margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">The Contagion Effect</h4>
      
      <p>
        Being attacked increases the likelihood of attacking others (r=0.42, p < 0.001).
        <strong> Toxicity is infectious.</strong>. Yet some communities resist it's pull. Help/Advice receives 11,589 negative links yet only sends 3,626.
        A strong positive identity appears to act as a buffer.
      </p>

    </div>

    <p style="margin-top:3rem;">
      Even so, this still doesn't resolve the core moral question. We can try reframing the story to have a better picture: <strong>Do attacks on Reddit mostly punch down or punch up?</strong>
    </p>

      The default assumption is bullying: powerful communities crushing weaker ones. 
      The network provides us with a clean way to test this. 
      For each negative link, compare the source's PageRank to the target's.
    </p>

    <p>
      If the source is larger than the target, that's punching down.
      If the source is smaller than the target, that's insurgency: punching up. 
      This is one of the few times <strong> Power</strong> can be quantified and analyzed.

    <h4 style="margin-bottom: 0.5rem;">The Insurgency Revelation</h4>
    
    <p>
    A striking <strong>73.9% of attacks punch UP.</strong> This shatters the bullying narrative. 
    Reddit isn't a platform where powerful communities crush weaker ones, it's a platform where smaller, less influential communities target the powerful.
    </p>

    <p>
      Low-PageRank attackers are ideologically extreme, status-seeking, and resentful. 
      They view mainstream communities as corrupt establishment and attacking popular targets is the fastest way to gain attention.
    </p>

    <p>
      The internet's populist rage flows upward. On Reddit, hostility is less a tool of oppression than a tool of insurgency.

    <p style="margin-top:3rem;">
      So far, we've mapped external conflict. But the real culture emerges when communities turn their energy inward. 
      <strong>What happens when they attack themselves?</strong>

    <p>
      We've seen how communities interact with their neighbors, now we ask: how do they treat <em>themselves</em>?
    </p>

    <p>
      When communities turn inward, they follow one of two paths. 
      Some experience internal strife, frequently clashing within their own ranks, we can label them as <strong>BattleGrounds</strong>. Others maintain internal peace.
      However, peace itself takes two forms: <strong>Crossroads</strong> which stay connected to the world while remaining civil internally and 
      <strong>Refuges</strong> who isolate themselves entirely, locked away but content.
    </p>

    <p>
      We visualized these patterns as a kind of physical geography:

        Exploring these islands makes one thing clear: isolation does not imply hostility. 
        While Battlegrounds buzz with internal conflict, the most secluded communities remain remarkably civil. This leads to an important insight.
      </p>

    <h3 id="purity-principle" class="section-header text-center" style="margin-top:2.5rem;">The Purity Principle: Isolation ≠ Toxicity</h3>

      <p>
        Echo chambers are assumed to be toxic. Yet, surprisingly the most isolated communities frequently turn out to be the most civil.
      </p>
      <p>
        To test this, we measured two dimensions: <strong>Purity</strong> (the percentage of links that remain within the cluster's boundaries) 
        and <strong>Internal Civility</strong> (the percentage of within-cluster links that are positive or neutral). 
        High purity indicates an echo chamber structure. High civility indicates a peaceful community.

      <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        The Japanese cluster demonstrates this paradox perfectly: 91.8% purity (highly isolated) yet 99.8% internal civility (remarkably peaceful). 
        The assumption that isolation breeds toxicity does not hold.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 2rem;">
        Isolation arises from self-sufficiency, not dogmatism. 
        Football fans and hobbyist communities thrive without needing extensive external links, 
        while science and health communities rely on broad connections to survive.

      <p>
        The most peaceful corners of Reddit are often the most secluded,
         whereas some of the most connected communities experience the highest levels of toxicity.

      LIWC reveals what attention sounds like.
    </h3>
      <p>
        So far, we've mapped Reddit's geography (continents), traffic (links), power (PageRank and betweenness),
        and conflict (rivalries, punching bags, insurgency).
        One missing remains: it's <strong>voice</strong>, the psychological and linguistic style communities use when interacting with each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        A community that sends 10,000 negative links could be <strong>trolling</strong>, <strong>critiquing</strong>, or conducting <strong>intellectual warfare</strong>, and you can't tell the difference from the network graph alone.
      </p>

      <p>
        We capture this layer using <strong>LIWC</strong> (Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count) 
        which detects <strong>anger</strong> ("hate," "kill"), <strong>anxiety</strong> ("worried," "nervous"), <strong>social focus</strong> ("we" vs "they"), <strong>cognitive style</strong> ("because," "therefore"), and 65 other dimensions.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        For example: The sentence <em>"I think you're completely wrong because your logic fails"</em> scores high on <strong>Certainty</strong> ("completely"), <strong>Cognitive Processing</strong> ("think," "logic"), and <strong>Negation</strong> ("wrong"). 
        Meanwhile, <em>"You're a f***ing idiot"</em> scores high on <strong>Anger</strong> and <strong>Swearing</strong>, but zero on <strong>Insight</strong>.
      </p>

    <h3 id="four-voices" class="section-header text-center" style="margin-top:3rem;">Four roles, four voices</h3>

    <p>
      The network roles weren't just structural, they also reveal distinct linguistic types.
      By comparing the <strong>relative lift</strong> of key LIWC features within each role to the global baseline, 
      we can see how each type of community communicates.

        <p style="margin:0;">
          Communities defined by outrage and outgroup focus. 
          They show elevated levels of <strong>anger</strong>, <strong>anxiety</strong>, <strong>sadness</strong>,
          frequently using <strong>“they”</strong> to point outward. Higher <strong>certainty</strong> signals confident condemnation rather than hesitation.

      The Asymmetry Paradox: How You Speak vs. How People Speak About You
    </h3>

    <p>
      The four roles describe group averages, but each subreddit has its own personality. 
      Thus a more nuanced question emerges: does a community's own tone match how others talk about it?
      To explore this, we compare outgoing anger (how a subreddit expresses itself) with incoming anger (how others direct their words toward it).

    <p style="margin-top:1.2rem;">
      Think of it as a heat map of attention: some communities radiate heat outward, sparking conflict and tension, while others draw it in, 
      absorbing reactions from across the network. On Reddit, tone doesn't simply flow; it collects, concentrates, and shapes the landscape of conversation.

    <h3 id="emotional-vs-cognitive" class="section-header text-center" style="margin-top:4rem;">Emotional vs. Cognitive Conflict</h3>
      <div class="media-row" style="display:flex;gap:2rem;align-items:center;flex-wrap:wrap;justify-content:center;margin-top:4rem;">
        <p>
          Our analysis found a distinct split in <em>how</em> communities attack.
          We measured <strong>Emotional Negativity</strong> (Anger + Swearing) versus <strong>Cognitive Negativity</strong> (Insight + Causal words).
          This reveals two very different types of hostile communities.
        </p>
        <p>
          The numbers that will be mentioned represents the <strong>linguistic density</strong>. A Troll Score of 0.091 means nearly <strong>9%</strong> of the words in those attacks are angry or profane;a raw emotional outburst. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In contrast, a high Critic Score means the attacks are packed with analytical words like <em>because</em>, <em>reason</em>, or <em>therefore</em>, signaling a debate rather than a fight.

          </p>
          <p>
            As seen in this example, the conflict is performative. The attacks are short, profane, and focused on "stupidity" rather than factual error. 
            They don't want to correct you; they want to upset you.

            They utilize logic as a weapon, scoring high on words like "because," "problem," and "if/then".
            In the example, the user isn't just angry; they are dismantling an argument about p-values using causal logic. 
            They explain <em>why</em> the other person is wrong.

      Finally, we asked what makes a community a true connector : a bridge between the different islands.
      High betweenness correlates with a distinctly human style: <strong>informal</strong>, <strong>social</strong>,
      and even slightly <strong>anxious</strong>. Bridges communicate like regular people, not institutions.

      They don't dominate through certainty or authority. 
      Instead, they succeed by being accessible: using casual language, agreement cues,
       social framing, and everyday topics that invite participation from diverse communities.

      <p>
        We analyzed attacks, supports, and isolation to find common patterns in how communities speak. 
        Our data reveals distinct linguistic codes that predict whether a community will fight or connect.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The Attack.</strong> When Reddit fights, it doesn't debate, it curses. 
        We found that swearing is <strong>10.1× higher</strong> in negative links compared to positive ones. 
        Anger is 8.2× higher, and sexualized insults appear 3.8× more often. 
        Nearly 1 in 50 words in a negative link is profane, confirming that online conflict is largely emotional warfare, not intellectual debate.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The Religion and Tribal Effect.</strong> Surprisingly, religious language ("God," "faith," "sin") is a top predictor of conflict (r=0.60). 
        This suggests that moralizing issues makes compromise impossible. 
        Similarly, we found that "Outgroup" language ("they," "them") predicts internal cannibalism. 
        Communities obsessed with outsiders eventually turn on themselves, political communities, for example, suffer from 14.9% internal negativity.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>The Isolation Paradox.</strong> Finally, we looked at what keeps communities apart. 
        We expected dogmatic, "certain" language to create echo chambers, but found no relationship (r=0.074). 
        Isolation isn't about being closed-minded, it's about specificity.

      <p>
        Reddit isn't what we thought it was. We expected a platform where the powerful crush the weak, where echo chambers breed toxicity, and where conflict spreads like wildfire. What we found was far more nuanced,and honestly, more interesting.
      </p>

      <p>
        The rage flows upward, not downward. Small communities attack large ones, not the other way around. Isolation doesn't create hate,it creates peace in unexpected places. The most civil corners of Reddit are often the most private. And when communities do fight, they don't use logic,they use emotion. Swearing, tribal language, and moral absolutes dominate conflict, while health and science language builds bridges.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here's the paradox: 90% of Reddit is positive, yet it <em>feels</em> toxic. Why? Because a tiny fraction of aggressive communities generate disproportionate noise. Negativity concentrates at its source, then scatters across many targets. A few bullies export hate to dozens of victims. The platform's architecture rewards civility with power, but allows small pockets of toxicity to punch far above their weight.
      </p>

      <p>
        What does this mean for building better online communities? Stop treating isolation as the enemy,it's often a refuge. Start recognizing that bridges aren't authorities; they're informal, anxious, social connectors who speak like regular people. And most importantly, understand that toxicity is contagious but curable. Strong community identity acts as a vaccine against hate.
      </p>

      <p>
        Reddit is a living map of human attention, emotion, and connection. Its collective mind is chaotic, surprisingly civil, and constantly evolving. By mapping its invisible architecture,structure, power, conflict, isolation, and voice,we've glimpsed patterns that challenge our assumptions about online behavior. The story Reddit tells about itself is messier than the headlines, and far more human than the algorithms.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-top: 2rem; font-style: italic; color: #666;">
        <strong>A note on limitations:</strong> The data spans 2014-2017, missing recent platform changes, focused on English-speaking communities, introducing geographical bias. LIWC captures patterns but misses sarcasm and intent. We analyzed structure, not causation,correlation doesn't prove why things happen. But the patterns are real, the numbers check out, and the story is worth hearing.
